This is now the CI-only repo for [Pokemon Sleep Info Wiki](https://pks.raenonx.cc).
It was open source, but not anymore, until further notice.

This decision was made because some users relentlessly report the website to ad-blockers,
so they can use the website ads-free, meaning that the developers are working for them, for free.

We have tried our best to be as open/polite as possible to ask the users to stop reporting us,
including publishing [this Ads & Credits notice](https://pks.raenonx.cc/en/docs/view/site/ads-and-credits).

We were fine allowing users to use adblock, just keep it under the table.
However, some users really like to yell it out loud and ask people to use ad-blockers.
We feel our work should be credited, therefore, despite that this is not really what we want,
we ended up deciding making the main repo private.
